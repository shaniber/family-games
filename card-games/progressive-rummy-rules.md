# üÉè Progressive Rummy

## Rules

Use 2 decks of cards for up to 4-6 players; for more players, add another deck of cards.  

Cut for deal; high card deals. Wild cards are excluded from the cut.  

Deal 13 cards to each player, then turn up a card to start the discard pile. If the dealer deals exactly 13 cards to each player, with or without a card turned up, on one cut of the deck, they get 100 points off their score. A player may only receive this once per game.  

Each player must complete each step before moving on to the next; only one step may be played each round.

A player may lay cards on other on other players‚Äô laid cards after completing the step they're, as play continues.

5 or more Wild cards dealt to any 1 player means a misdeal; if the dealer has dealt exactly 13 cards each in that deal, they do not receive the 100 points off their score.

Jokers and Deuces are wild. Jokers only may be ‚Äústolen‚Äù from another players run by replacing it with the actual card; Jokers may not be stolen from Sets. Sets and runs cannot be constructed of a majority of wildcards. 

Aces are high; Runs must be in suits of 3 through Ace.

Winner is the player with the lowest score of those who complete Step 7.
